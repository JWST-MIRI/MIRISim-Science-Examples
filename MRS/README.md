# Simulated MIRI MRS Science Examples


This directory houses the Jupyter Notebooks outlining example science cases that can be realised using the MIRI Medium Resolution Spectrometer (MRS).

## Examples

1) [MIRISim_SN1987A_eg.ipynb](https://github.com/JWST-MIRI/MIRISim-Science-Examples/blob/master/MRS/MIRISim_SN1987A_eg.ipynb) simulates observing SN1987A with the full spectral range of the MRS. An approximation of SN1987A is generated using a cold blackbody to replicate the inner ejecta, and a resolved ring of warm dust with atomic emission lines that all fit within the MRS field of view. 
The file [SN1987A_ring_microJy.txt](https://github.com/JWST-MIRI/MIRISim-Science-Examples/blob/master/MRS/SN1987A_ring_microJy.txt) repesenting emission from the ring of SN1987A needs to be downloaded to successfully run this notebook.
