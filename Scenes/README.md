# MIRISim Science Example Astronomical Scenes

Often the same scenes can be used for multiple simulations.  Re-useable MIRISim created scenes can be placed in this directory for use
throughtout the simulations.

## Note on data storage 

To keep the repository small, no external data files should be placed here - only internal MIRISim scene definitions. If a scene
needs an external SED or FITS file, they should be stored remotely and refered to in the scene generating notebook placed in this repository.
