# Simulated MIRI LRS Science Examples


This directory houses the Jupyter Notebooks outlining example science cases that can be realised using the MIRI Low Resolution Spectrometer (LRS).

## Examples

1) [MIRISim_YDwarf_LRS.ipynb](https://github.com/JWST-MIRI/MIRISim-Science-Examples/blob/master/LRS/MIRISim_YDwarf_LRS) simulates observing the cool atmosphere of a Y dwarf with the LRS. In this notebook we create a scene with a point source representing the Y dwarf, add a model atmosphere for its spectral energy distribution (SED), and run through a MIRISim simulation. The file [morley_ydwarf_mirisim.txt](https://github.com/JWST-MIRI/MIRISim-Science-Examples/blob/master/LRS/morley_ydwarf_mirisim.txt) needs to be downloaded to successfully run this notebook.
