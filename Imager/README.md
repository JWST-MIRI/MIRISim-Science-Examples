# Simulated MIRI Imager Science Examples


This directory houses the Jupyter Notebooks outlining example science cases that can be realised using the MIRI imager.

## Examples

1) [MIRISim_IMA_1Zw18_eg.ipynb](https://github.com/JWST-MIRI/MIRISim-Science-Examples/blob/master/Imager/MIRISim_IMA_1Zw18_eg.ipynb) simulates observing a resolved stellar population including YSOs and AGB stars in a local galaxy (1 Zw 18) using several filters.  In addition to this notebook four files representing the spectra of YSOs and AGB stars need to be downloaded to successfully run this notebook. These files are: [av_CAGB.txt](https://github.com/JWST-MIRI/MIRISim-Science-Examples/blob/master/Imager/av_CAGB.txt),  [av_OAGB.txt](https://github.com/JWST-MIRI/MIRISim-Science-Examples/blob/master/Imager/av_OAGB.txt),  [av_YSO1.txt](https://github.com/JWST-MIRI/MIRISim-Science-Examples/blob/master/Imager/av_YSO1.txt),  [av_YSO3.txt](https://github.com/JWST-MIRI/MIRISim-Science-Examples/blob/master/Imager/av_YSO3.txt).
